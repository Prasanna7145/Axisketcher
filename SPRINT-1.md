# Sprint Planning
In this sprint we planned for X and Y axis movement of Bot. To achieve this first we have to take 30cm two wood pieces and place it to a base.Then two Stepper motor(Nema 17) are placed into the two ends of wood pieces and in between there are 8mm holes are made to place thread rod and stud rod and then it is connect to the motors and mount the another wood piece oover it perpendicular .Connect the two motors with  L298N module driver to arduino mega 2560   and upload code.And servo motor is mounted on the upper piece of wood for pen up and down.
