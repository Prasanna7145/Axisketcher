# Abstract
A drawing robot is the one which draws patterns on the given paper as per the instructions given. These bots are most commonly used in arts and crafts store. This bot saves a lot of humanâ€™s effort and time. The Axisketcher Bot is one such machine which is designed to draw patterns as
per the given instructions. The instructions are given through Arduino software to arduino board. The bot moves in X-axis and Y-axis, across a pre-defined coordinates and draws on the paper as per the instructions. The X-axis and Y-axis is functioned through NEMA 17 stepper motor with the drivers L298N.  The functionality of drawing has been achieved through pen-holder. And the functionality of up and down movement of the pen has been achieved through a servo motor. The integration of these functions gives out the output.
