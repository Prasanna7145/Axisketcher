# INTRODUCTION
## ROBOT :
A robot is a machine designed to execute one or more tasks automatically with speed and precision. There are as many different types of robots as there are tasks for them to perform.
Robots that resemble humans are known as androids; however, many robots aren't built on the human model. Industrial robots, for example, are often designed to perform repetitive tasks that aren't facilitated by a human-like construction. A robot can be remotely controlled by a human operator, sometimes from a great distance. A telecoil is a complex robot that is remotely controlled by a human operator for a telepresence system, which gives that individual the sense of being on location in a remote, dangerous or alien environment and the ability to interact with it. 
An autonomous robot acts as a stand-alone system, complete with its own computer (called the controller). The most advanced example is the smart robot, which has a built-in artificial intelligence (AI) system that can learn from its environment and its experience and build on its capabilities based on that knowledge.[1]

### 2 POINTILLIST PAINTING ROBOT ARM
### 1.uses a minimum number of power supplies
###  2.uses a minimum number of electronic components
### 3.uses inexpensive motors
### 4.has a minimal user interface
### 5.has easily accessible electronics
While there are many robots that have been used to make paintings,  they often take more mechanical postures: polar plotters, delta arms, XY gantry plotters, multi-degree-of-freedom arms that paint on horizontal surfaces etc. I wanted to make an industrial-styled machine that resembled the more organic form of a traditional portrait painter using a canvas.

### 3. AUTOMATIC SKETCHING MACHINE
Drawing perfect sketch by hand can now be done by machines too. Here we propose an automated image sketching machine that sketches drawings similar to a real human but with a lot more accuracy. The proposed system makes use of an Arduino based circuitry that is interfaced with motors and belt based setup that is used to provide the mechanism needed by a pen to draw the sketch. The Arduino based circuit is interfaced with 2 stepper motors and one servo motor in order to transmit the movement commands as per the image fed to it. It then controls the sketching process through a well-controlled mechanism in order to achieve this task. The pen only touches the paper where a dot is to be placed is raised above the paper by the motor where not needed. This motion coupled with the x and y axis movement of the motors allows for a 2D sketching mechanism on the paper using this mechanism.
