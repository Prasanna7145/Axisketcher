# NEED STATEMENT:
In an art and craft supply store there is a need of machine, which draws given shape and patterns on a paper for further use.
Brainstorming and basic literature survey helps the design team to understand the problem and helps to arrive at defining problem statement.
## Objectives:
### Robot/Machine should be able to design a given shape or patterns.
### Robot /Machine should be affordable (Cost Expensive).
### Robot/Machine must be user friendly.
### It must be Automatic.
### The robot should be portable and rugged.
## Problem definition Version 1.1:
### Design a robot to draw a given shape or a pattern . It should be affordable , user friendly. The robot should work automatically. It should be portable and rugged.
## Constraints:
### Cost of robot must not exceed Rs 3000.
### Robot must not exceed 2.5kgs.
### It must draw at least 4 patterns .
### It should be able to draw for at least 3 hours continuously.

## Problem definition Version 1.2
### Design a robot to draw a given a shape or a pattern. The expenses of the robot should not exceed Rs 3000. The weight of  the robot should not exceed 2.5 kgs. It should be able to draw at least 4 patterns. It should be able to draw for at least continuously.

## Functions
### Robot should be able to rotate the pen at all angles (360 degrees) freely.
### It should be able to draw multiple sketches simultaneously.
### It should be able to hold pens/pencils of different thickness.

## Problem definition Version 1.3
### Design a robot to draw a given shape or a pattern. The pen arm of the robot should rotate freely at all angles (360 degrees). It should be able to draw multiple sketches simultaneously. The robot should be able to hold pen/pencil of different thickness.
# Prioritize Comparison Chart(PCC):
Goals can be ranked in order of decreasing value of importance and hence it is user friendly, affordable and portable
